# Inventory Optimization Project

## Project Overview

Welcome to the Inventory Optimization Project! This project aims to address the challenge of efficiently managing inventory levels while meeting customer demand. Effective inventory management is crucial for businesses to minimize holding costs, reduce stockouts, and maximize profits. This project leverages demand forecasting techniques and optimization strategies to strike the right balance.

## Project Highlights

- **Demand Forecasting:** We have developed a Demand Forecasting model using machine learning techniques to predict future demand for our products. Accurate demand forecasts are fundamental to effective inventory optimization.

- **Inventory Optimization:** Using the demand forecasts and historical data, we will implement various inventory optimization strategies to determine the optimal inventory levels, reorder points, and order quantities.

- **Python and Data Science:** This project utilizes Python, along with popular data science libraries like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and statsmodels, to build and deploy predictive models and optimization algorithms.

- **Reusable Models:** Our Demand Forecasting model is designed to be reusable. You can easily import it into other projects to make demand predictions for new data.

## Project Structure

- **Demand Forecasting:** We start by loading the Demand Forecasting model and generating demand forecasts for the products.

- **Inventory Optimization:** We then implement inventory optimization strategies, considering factors like lead time, holding costs, service levels, and demand variability.

- **Results and Recommendations:** The project will provide insights, reports, and recommendations for optimizing inventory levels.
